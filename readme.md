This is my entry in the second OMGWTF coding contest over at http://omg2.thedailywtf.com/

This program works by building a binary tree of random mathematical operations
which gets mutated until for a specific input the amount of odd and even results
over the whole tree are equal.

Then we take a random path in the binary tree with a specific input (which may
or may not be the number the tree was trained against) and look
at the result and put out yes or no in case the result is even or odd.
